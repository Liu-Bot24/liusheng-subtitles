</div>

Liusheng Subtitles is a Chrome extension for generating and translating subtitles for web videos. It is designed for streaming videos that have no subtitles, incomplete subtitles, or foreign-language subtitles that need to be translated into the selected target language.

After opening a video page, Liusheng Subtitles shows available media sources in the side panel. Configure an ASR provider and an LLM translation provider, then generate original subtitles, translated subtitles, or bilingual subtitles and display them on the page.

## Features

- Discover video sources on the current web page.
- Generate original subtitles and translate them into the selected target language.
- Switch between translated text, original text, and bilingual display.
- Show subtitles as a page overlay or in the side-panel subtitle list.
- Import SRT, VTT, ASS/SSA, and extension JSON subtitle files.
- Export subtitles as SRT.
- Cache subtitles locally so the same page can load existing subtitles later.
- Support OpenAI Whisper, Groq Whisper, xAI Grok, Fun-ASR, and custom ASR endpoints.
- Support OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, and custom LLM translation endpoints.

## Usage

## Privacy
